> A Go port of the popular API development tool, Hoppscotch.

## üöÄ Why 'hoppscotch-backend-go'?

With the aim of reduce the image size and resource usage, I've taken up the challenge to create a backend implementation in Go. This not only leverages the power and performance of Go but also contributes to the diversity of tools available for developers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features:

- Go Power: Benefit from the speed and efficiency of Go.
- Compatibility: Designed to seamlessly integrate with the Hoppscotch frontend.
- Easy Setup: Simple installation and configuration for a Hoppscotch-like experience.

## Demo
[hoppscotch.ling.sh](hoppscotch.ling.sh)

## Developing
This project is build on `gqlgen` and `gorm`. please see related [documents](https://gqlgen.com/) for more information.

### Project structure
```

  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graphql               # graphql schema
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd                       # main entrypoints
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dummper               # database schema dumpper
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server                # main server
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ import-meta-env       # go port of nodejs import-meta-env
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graphql               # graphql endpoints
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dto             # dto models
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rest                  # rest endpoints
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg           
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exception
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mail
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model                 # database models
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session               # jwt token related
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template                  # email templates
```

### Tips:
> `OwnersCount`, `EditorsCount` and `ViewersCount` alterd to return `int64` instead of `int`, because gorm return `int64` type in `count` function.


## Continuous Integration
We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Check out our build workflows.

### Build & Push
`import-meta-env` and main `server` are built using `go build` in `go_builder` image.

`nginx.conf`, `healthcheck.sh`, `template` from project root folder, `import-meta-env`, `server` from `go_builder` and `site` from `hoppscotch/hoppscotch:latest` are copied to `nginx:latest` image.

Port `3000/tcp`, `3100/tcp`, `3170/tcp` are exposed.

The product image are pushed to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ling7334/hoppscotch).
